/**
 * A graph is collection of two sets V and E where V is a finite non-empty
 * set of vertices and E is a finite non-empty set of edges
 *
 * Graph is a non-linear data structure
 * It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges
 * Each node can have any number of edges
 * There is no unique node called root in graph
 * A cycle can be formed
 * Applications: For finding shortest path in networking graph is used
